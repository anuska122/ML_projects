### Book Recommendation System
- Here I have applied Popularity based and Collaborative filtering based recommendation system.
-  Popularity-Based Recommendation works on the basis of metrics like total number of ratings or average rating.
- . Collaborative Filtering works by finding patterns among user-item interactions (ratings, likes, purchases) and makes predictions using the "wisdom of the crowd".
